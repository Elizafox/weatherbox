This is Weatherbox, the code to my personal weather station.

Everything here is licensed CC0 (public domain). Use it as you wish. Or don't. I'm not your mother.

My setup uses an ESP32 and an Arduino Nano 33 BLE in communication via I2C (I couldn't get SPI to
work). This is probably not the most ideal setup, but it's the one I chose, and it works. At some
future point, I'll probably just migrate over to an Arduino Nano 33 IoT or something.
